# Part A- Image Generation
## Variational Autoencoder
Training the VAE on MNIST dataset and then randomly sampling 5 latant variables in dimension sizes of 2,4,8,16,32,64 and then generating new images

## Generative Adverserial Network
Training the GAN on MNIST dataset and then randomly sampling 5 latant variables in dimension sizes of 2,4,8,16,32,64 and then generating new images

# Part B- Image to Image Generation
